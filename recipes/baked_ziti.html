    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Baked ziti is a casserole with ziti pasta and a Neapolitan-style tomato sauce. It is a characteristic of Italian-American cuisine. It is a form of pasta al forno.</p>
    <p>Typically, the pasta is first boiled separately until it is nearly, but not completely, done. The almost-cooked pasta is added to a tomato-based sauce. The tomato-coated pasta is then combined with cheese, typically a mixture of ricotta, mozzarella, and Parmesan. Other ingredients can be added with the cheese, such as ground meat, sausage, mushrooms, peppers, and onions. The combined ingredients are placed in a baking dish, covered with mozzarella cheese, baked in the oven and served hot.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1 pound dry ziti pasta</li>
      <li>1 onion, chopped</li>
      <li>1 pound lean ground beef</li>
      <li>2 (26 ounce) jars spaghetti sauce</li>
      <li>6 ounces provolone cheese, sliced</li>
      <li>1 1/2 cups sour cream</li>
      <li>6 ounces mozzarella cheese, shredded</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Add ziti pasta, and cook until al dente, about 8 minutes; drain.</li>
      <li>Meanwhile, brown ground beef and onion in a large skillet over medium heat; stir in spaghetti sauce and simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
      <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Butter a 9x13-inch baking dish.</li>
      <li>Spread 1/2 of the ziti in the bottom of the prepared dish; top with Provolone cheese, sour cream, 1/2 of the meat sauce, remaining ziti, mozzarella cheese, and remaining meat sauce. Top with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
      <li>Bake in the preheated oven until heated through and cheeses have melted, about 30 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
